we have three files main_file1,main_file2,main_file3

1 ) 	In main_file1 we have to run it in matlab and browse the corresponding image and after that enter the starrt and the end wavelength and we will see the output image after some patience 
Some values for wavelength 
360 to 480 unknown, must be infrared
480 to 505 blue
505 to 565 green
565 to 575 yellow
575 to 595 orange
595 to 660 red + voilet (ya both are lost somewhere)

2 ) 	In main_file2 it will give only the histogram ie it will plot the histogram after normalization
X axis is wavelength Y axis is the probability 

3 ) 	In main_file3 what it does 
it takes all the images in a folder named "color" present in the current directory 
it calculates the histogram then it will get the normalized histogram and then computes the mean and variance for all the histograms and then calculate the new centers for K mean clustering and then it will compute the clusters and display the results and we need to keep patience for this. In the cod3e there is bicubic interpolation is used to keep the size of image low to save time. Otherwise it might take 2 hours.  

Note : don't go through all the .m files and functions. Some are redundant and useless
