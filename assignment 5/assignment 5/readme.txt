In this assignment 5 
we need to run main_file1.m 
the file named RGBD data should be in the working directory
total 10 images will be created each showing the local topology 


it will display local topology for each coordinate 

in principal curvature case 
the images with the suffix 1 are the images for the principle curvature case
a proper image patch with 8 connectivity is filled with a given random color

in mean and gaussian curvature case 
the images with the suffix 2 are the images for the mean and gaussian curvature case
a proper image patch with 8 connectivity is filled with a given random color
